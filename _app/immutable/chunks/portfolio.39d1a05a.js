The project explores key factors such as historical stock prices, daily returns, trading volumes, and seasonal trends to understand the companys market performance over time.",description:`Hello, my name is Ashkan Zahabiuon, and for Project 2, we are going through this data analysis project which focuses on investigating various trends in Apple Inc stock prices over time using a detailed Kaggle dataset. 

<h2>Introduction</h2> 
Apple Inc. is a multinational technology company renowned for its innovative products and services, including the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, and various software solutions. Since its inception, Apple has become a leading player in the tech industry, and its stock performance reflects its market influence and financial health. Analyzing Apple stock data over an extended period provides valuable insights into market trends, investor sentiment, and the company growth trajectory. This project aims to explore historical stock data to identify patterns, understand fluctuations, and assess factors that have influenced Apple stock prices. 

<h2>Data Description</h2> 
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from a comprehensive [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varpit94/apple-stock-data-updated-till-22jun2021), containing historical stock data of Apple Inc. from **December 12, 1980**, to **June 22, 2021**. The dataset comprises **10,244 observations** and **7 columns**, providing a substantial amount of data to explore. Each observation represents daily stock information, and the columns include variables such as: 
- **Date**: The trading date. 
- **Open**: Opening price of the stock on that day. 
- **High**: Highest price of the stock during the trading day. 
- **Low**: Lowest price of the stock during the trading day. 
- **Close**: Closing price of the stock on that day. 
- **Adj Close**: Adjusted closing price accounting for corporate actions like stock splits and dividends. 
- **Volume**: The number of shares traded on that day. 

<h2>Data Pre-processing</h2> 
To ensure meaningful analysis, the dataset was cleaned and pre-processed through several steps: 
- **Handling Missing Data**: Identified missing values in price columns. Since the number of missing entries was minimal, those rows were dropped to maintain data integrity. 
- **Standardizing Formats**: Converted the \`Date\` column to a datetime object to facilitate chronological analyses and time-series visualizations. 
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted additional features such as \`Year\`, \`Month\`, \`Day\`, and \`DayOfWeek\` from the \`Date\` column to enable detailed temporal analysis. Calculated \`Daily Return\` to assess stock volatility. 
- **Outlier Detection**: Reviewed data for any anomalies or outliers in stock prices and trading volumes to ensure accuracy. 
- **Adjusting for Corporate Actions**: Used the \`Adj Close\` prices to account for stock splits and dividends, providing a consistent basis for historical comparison. Once the data was prepared, several visualizations were created to uncover trends and patterns within the dataset. One of the key observations from the initial analysis was the significant growth in Apple stock price over the years, particularly after the launch of breakthrough products like the iPod in 2001, the iPhone in 2007, and the iPad in 2010. This growth reflects Apple increasing market share and profitability.

The project explores key factors such as the frequency of incidents, types of schools affected, weapons used, and state-by-state comparisons.",description:`Hello, my name is Ash Zahabiuon, and for Project 1, we are going through this data analysis project which focuses on investigating various trends in school shootings across the United States using a detailed Kaggle dataset.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
School shootings have become an increasingly critical issue in the United States, posing significant threats to the safety and well-being of students and educators alike. The frequency of these tragic events has risen over the years, making it imperative to understand the underlying factors contributing to this crisis. Analyzing detailed data on school shootings can provide valuable insights into patterns and trends, informing policies and preventive measures to enhance school safety.

<h2>Data Description</h2>
The dataset includes extensive information such as the frequency of shootings, the types of schools affected (ranging from elementary schools to high schools and universities), the weapons involved, the location of each incident, and casualty details. The dataset comprises **489 observations** and **27 columns**, providing a substantial amount of data to explore. Each observation represents a unique school shooting incident, and the columns include variables such as:

- **Date**: When the incident occurred
- **Location**: City and state of the school
- **School Type**: Elementary, middle, high school, or university
- **Weapon Type**: Handgun, rifle, shotgun, etc.
- **Casualties**: Number of injuries and fatalities
- **Shooter Details**: Age, gender, and affiliation to the school

<h2>Data Pre-processing</h2>
In terms of data preparation, I cleaned and pre-processed the dataset to ensure meaningful comparisons across variables. This involved several steps:

- **Handling Missing Data**: Identified missing values in critical columns like weapon type and casualty numbers. Missing numerical values were imputed with the median or mean, while missing categorical values were filled using the mode or labeled as "Unknown" where appropriate.
- **Standardizing Formats**: Dates were standardized to a uniform format (\`YYYY-MM-DD\`) to facilitate chronological analyses. Time-related columns were converted to datetime objects for accurate time-series analysis. Also these dates were then thrown into seasonal data so it was far easier to read/understand.
- **Categorizing Schools**: Schools were categorized by grade levels to allow for comparative analysis across different educational institutions. This involved grouping schools into elementary, middle, high schools, and universities based on the provided data.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Converted categorical variables such as weapon types and locations into numerical codes using label encoding and one-hot encoding techniques, which are necessary for certain statistical analyses and visualizations.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identified and reviewed outliers in casualty numbers to ensure they were accurate reports and not data entry errors.
- **Data Integration**: Merged additional datasets where necessary to enrich the analysis, such as state-level information.

Once cleaned, I created several visualizations to further understand the trends within the dataset. One thing I realized when looking at the chart was the number of school shootings per year, which shows a steady increase, particularly from the early 2000s onward. This trend shows the urgency of addressing the issue, with a significant rise in incidents post-2010.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrScruffles/ashz/main/static/screenshots/Project1/all_seasons_shootings.png" alt="All Seasons Shootings Plot" width="1200">

I also explored regional trends by analyzing how different states are affected by school shootings. States like Texas and California stood out with particularly high numbers of shootings, prompting me to investigate underlying reasons. Could it be related to the sheer number of schools, or are there other contributing factors such as local security policies? These questions raised critical concerns about whether schools are investing enough in active security measures, especially in larger campuses.

In investigating the relationship between weapon types and casualty rates, I found that rifles, compared to handguns, resulted in higher casualty rates. This insight is critical for understanding the impact of different firearm types in these incidents and may inform policies on weapon accessibility and control measures in school environments. The data showed that incidents involving rifles had an average of 5 casualties per event, whereas handguns averaged 2 casualties.

Additionally, I analyzed seasonal trends by creating four distinct charts representing school shootings in Fall, Winter, Spring, and Summer. These charts provided new insights, especially as the data for 2024 became available. Fall emerged as a particularly high-risk period, with a sharp increase in shootings in September and October. Winter also showed a high frequency of incidents, particularly in December and January. Spring trends fluctuated, with March and April showing higher rates, while Summer, when schools are largely out of session, saw fewer incidents overall.

Understanding these seasonal trends could be crucial in forming strategies for heightened security during peak months. For example, knowing that shootings increase in Fall and Winter could inform decisions to enhance security during these periods.

Beyond seasonal analysis, I created state-by-state visualizations, highlighting areas most affected by school shootings. These maps revealed that some regions, such as Texas and California, consistently experience more frequent incidents. This points to the need for solutions that address all schools, especially those that are frequently targeted. Even during the COVID-19 year of 2020, shootings continued, which is a stark reminder of the crisis.
