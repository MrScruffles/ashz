    description: 'This data analysis project focuses on investigating various trends in school shootings across the United States using a detailed Kaggle dataset. The dataset includes critical information such as the frequency of shootings, the type of schools affected (ranging from elementary schools to high schools and universities), the weapons involved, the location of each incident, and casualty details. School shootings have been steadily increasing each year, and this dataset provides essential insights into understanding and addressing the crisis. \n\nIn my analysis, I focused on examining key factors such as how the number of shootings has risen year after year, which types of schools (elementary, middle, high schools, and universities) are more frequently targeted, and the relationship between weapon types and casualty rates. For example, my findings showed that rifles, when compared to handguns, which is obvious why but an important fact to know. \n\nI also explored regional trends by analyzing how different states are affected by school shootings. States like Texas and California stood out with particularly high numbers of shootings, which prompted me to explore the underlying reasons why? Could it be from the sheer amount of schools here, or are there other underlying reasons? This raised critical questions if schools are putting enough effort into protecting the students like having more active security on bigger campuses like this plays a big role. \n\nIn terms of data preparation, I cleaned and pre-processed the dataset to ensure that meaningful comparisons could be made across different variables. This involved handling missing data, standardizing time and date formats, and categorizing schools by their grade levels. Once cleaned, I created several visualizations to further understand the trends within the dataset. \n\nOne key visualization I created was a chart depicting the number of school shootings per year, which clearly shows a steady increase in incidents, especially from the early 2000s onward. This highlights a disturbing trend, reinforcing the urgency of addressing the issue. The visual further indicates that the years after 2010 have seen a significant uptick in the frequency of incidents.\n\nAdditionally, I broke down the data by seasons to investigate whether certain times of the year see more shootings. I created four distinct charts representing school shootings in each season-Fall, Winter, Spring, and Summer. These charts revealed some insights, as the data is relatively new for the year of 2024, but what I notice is fall tends to have a higher frequency of shootings, with a sharp rise observed in September and October. In Winter, incidents are also prominent, particularly in December and January, which might coincide with the heightened stress and activity around the end of the year. The Spring season showed somewhat fluctuating trends, with March and April seeing higher shooting rates. Finally, Summer had fewer incidents overall, possibly due to the fact that most schools are out of session during these months.\n\nThe seasonal trends I uncovered could be critical in forming strategies for enhanced security or preventative measures during peak months of the year. For instance, knowing that shootings tend to spike in Fall and Winter could help inform decisions about increasing security measures around these periods.\n\nBeyond the time-based analysis, I also created state-by-state maps that highlight which areas are most affected by school shootings. These visualizations revealed that certain regions consistently experience more frequent incidents, pointing to the importance of finding a solution that is effective for all schools, not just the ones that come under target. If during Covid year (2020) there were still shootings which is already a horrible metric. \n\nBy analyzing these patterns and producing various visualizations, I was able to draw conclusions that provide valuable insights into the broader picture of school shootings across the United States. This analysis could contribute to important discussions around school safety reforms and the potential for implementing measures such as improved school security.',    shortDescription: 'A comprehensive data analysis project examining trends in school shootings using a Kaggle dataset.
